# Design pattern
## Creational patterns 
Creational patterns provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.
- [Prototype](./design-pattern/prototype/README.md)
- [Builder](./design-pattern/builder/README.md)
## Structural patterns 
Structural patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.
- [Facade](./design-pattern/facade/README.md)
- [Bridge](./design-pattern/bridge/README.md)
## Behavioral patterns
Behavioral patterns take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
- [Strategy](./design-pattern/strategy/README.md)
- [Mediator](./design-pattern/mediator/README.md)
# Go
## Go channel
Channels are the pipes that connect concurrent goroutines. You can send values into channels from one goroutine and receive those values into another goroutine.

Examples:
- [Fibonacci](./go/channel/fibonacci/README.md)
- [Producer/Consumer](./go/channel/producer-consumer/README.md)
- [Fan-Out/Fan-In](./go/channel/fan-out-fan-in/README.md)
