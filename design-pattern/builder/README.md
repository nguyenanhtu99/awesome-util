# Builder pattern
Builder is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.
## Problem
Imagine that you're building a house, which involves several steps like installing windows, doors, floors, and more. After finishing, you realize winter is approaching, and you need to construct another house to stay warm during the colder months. Once again, you have to go through the entire processâ€”building windows, doors, floors, and this time, adding furniture suitable for winter.
## Solution
In this scenario, we can apply the builder pattern to streamline the construction process. Since each type of house follows the same steps, the builder pattern ensures consistency and simplicity. Additionally, an optional director struct can be used to effectively manage and organize the building process.
